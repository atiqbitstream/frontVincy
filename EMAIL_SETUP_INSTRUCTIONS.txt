Subject: Quick Setup Needed - Email Notifications for Your Website

Hi,

I need your help to enable automatic email notifications on your website. The system will send emails when:
- A new user signs up (you'll get notified)
- You approve or reject a user (they'll get notified)

Since your email (info@soulresidue.net) is hosted by Google Workspace, we need to create a special "App Password" for security. This is different from your regular password.

Here's what you need to do:

STEP 1: Make sure 2-Step Verification is ON
----------------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Sign in with: info@soulresidue.net
3. Scroll down to "2-Step Verification"
4. If it says "OFF", click it and turn it ON
5. Follow the instructions to set it up (usually using your phone)

STEP 2: Create an App Password
----------------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. You might need to sign in again
3. Under "App name", type: Dr Vince Website
4. Click "Create"
5. Google will show you a 16-character password like: abcd efgh ijkl mnop
6. COPY THIS PASSWORD (it's shown only once!)
7. Send it to me

That's it! Once I have this password, the email system will be fully working.

Note: This App Password is ONLY for the website to send emails. It won't work for logging into your email account, so it's safe.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks,
[Your Name]
